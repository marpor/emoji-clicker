# Ideas 

## Idea: Change the Name of the Game

`index.html` is where the action is. You'll want to make sure to replace the name inside both `<title>` and `<h1>` tags. 

## Idea: Change the Emoji

Also in `index.html`. Hard to miss, but make sure to leave the surrounding `<button><span id="emoji">` intact.

You can type emojis by pressing **Win + .** (on Windows) or the **Globe key** (on Mac), then type in a word to search.

You can also use a site such as https://unicode.party/

## Idea: Make the Emoji larger

The current size is defined by the CSS selector `#game button`. Since our Emojis are actually text, their size is controlled by `font-size`.

## Idea: Remove Emoji Button Background

Maybe your game is better without a button under the Emoji?

Look for the `background`, `border` and `box-shadow` in both  `#game button` and `#game button:active`.

## Idea: Change the Background

You can control the background of either the entire page (via a rule for `body`), the `.left` or `.right` sides (or `#game` and `#upgrade`).

## Idea: Add a new upgrade type

The behavior of each existing upgrade type is implemented with code.

Start by looking at one of the existing types.

Search (Ctrl+F) for it's name (for example `farm`) in `script.js`.

Copy or adjust the behavior in the places needed.
